# Liquidity Generation Event

## Summary

The **Liquidity Generation Event (LGE)** is the **genesis phase** of the Welsh Street Exchange ecosystem.
It distributes **20,000,000 STREET tokens** to early participants who contribute **WELSH** to the on-chain **genesis contract** during a two-week event window.

- **Duration:** 14 days
- **Contribution asset:** WELSH
- **Contract:** Secure on-chain genesis contract
- **Distribution:** 20,000,000 STREET tokens allocated pro-rata
- **Refunds:** **None.** All contributions are final.
- **Liquidity:** None created during LGE (no LP tokens minted).
- **Airdrop:** STREET tokens distributed manually within ~1 week after close.

---

## Overview

During the two-week LGE window, participants send **WELSH tokens** to the **genesis contract address**.
Each transfer updates a **data map** stored on-chain that tracks total contributions per user.

At the end of the event:
- The contract is closed.
- Final totals are recorded on-chain.
- STREET tokens are distributed via a **manual airdrop** approximately one week after the event concludes, based on each participant’s share of total WELSH contributed.

### No Refunds

All contributions are **non-refundable**.
Participants permanently exchange their contributed WELSH for their corresponding allocation of STREET, which will be airdropped after the event ends.

---

## Mechanics

### 1. Contribution Window
- The event runs for **14 consecutive days**.
- Users may contribute **multiple times**; each new contribution adds to their cumulative total.
- Contributions are accepted only in **WELSH** via the genesis contract.

### 2. On-Chain Data (Source of Truth)
- The contract records:
- A **list of participant principals**.
- A **map of cumulative WELSH totals** per principal.
- These on-chain records are the **sole source** for the final airdrop calculations.

### 3. Off-Chain Data (UX Only)
- An off-chain database mirrors on-chain events to power:
- Progress bars and contribution charts.
- Leaderboards and metadata (wallet nickname, timestamp, etc.).
- **Only users who contribute through the frontend** have their metadata recorded (wallet name, timestamp, country flag, etc.).
- **Direct contract interactions** (via CLI, API, or Stacks Explorer) are **still valid** and fully credited in the final airdrop,
but **their metadata will not appear** in the frontend display.


## Distribution Phase

After the 14-day window:
1. The genesis contract is closed.
2. Final contribution totals are exported from the blockchain.
3. **STREET tokens are airdropped** to participant addresses **within approximately one week**.
4. Airdrops are based entirely on **on-chain totals** recorded by the genesis contract.

> ⚠️ There is **no liquidity pool** created during this event.
> **No LP tokens** are minted or distributed.
> Liquidity seeding, if any, occurs separately after the LGE.

## Metadata & Privacy

| Method | On-Chain Record | Off-Chain Metadata | Displayed in Frontend |
|---------|------------------|--------------------|-----------------------|
| **Frontend (App)** | ✅ Contribution total | ✅ Wallet, timestamp, country flag | ✅ Yes |
| **Direct Contract Call (CLI/Explorer)** | ✅ Contribution total | ❌ None recorded | ❌ No |

All allocations are based solely on on-chain totals, regardless of frontend tracking.

---

## Security & Transparency

- **Immutable ledger:** Every contribution and wallet is verifiable on-chain.
- **Non-custodial:** Funds are held by the contract, not a team wallet.
- **Transparent airdrop:** The airdrop list and total allocations are public and verifiable.
- **Frontend optional:** On-chain contributions always count.

---

## Core Principles

1. **Fair Launch:**
 Every contributor participates under the same conditions. There are no pre-sales or private allocations.

2. **Transparency:**
 All contributions are recorded on-chain and viewable by anyone.

3. **Fixed STREET Supply:**
 Exactly 20,000,000 STREET are distributed through the LGE—no more, no less.

4. **Flexible Liquidity Ratio:**
 The 1:100 ratio between STREET and WELSH is a target, not a rule.
 The deployer may adjust this ratio at the time of liquidity deployment to reflect actual conditions.

5. **Community Participation:**
 Major allocation choices (e.g., surplus or rewards handling) will be shared and discussed publicly through official Welsh Street social channels such as **X**.

---

## Market Adjustment & Liquidity Allocation Policy

Because the LGE runs for two weeks, the market price of **WELSH** may change significantly during the event.
To handle both **over-subscription** and **under-subscription** fairly, the following framework applies:

1. **Fixed STREET Allocation**
 The total of **20,000,000 STREET** distributed to participants does not change, regardless of market movements or total WELSH raised.

2. **Adjustable Liquidity Ratio**
 The **1 : 100** ratio between STREET and WELSH is **not hard-coded**.
 After the LGE ends, the deployer will apply the initial liquidity manually and may adjust this ratio to reflect actual market conditions and the total WELSH raised.

---

### Oversubscription Scenario (More than 20 M WELSH Raised)

When more WELSH is raised than the target (for example, 30 M WELSH):

- The deployer may use **more WELSH** in the liquidity pool (e.g., 30 M WELSH + 2 B STREET) to strengthen market depth.
- Any **excess WELSH** not used in the pool may be:
- Allocated to the **Rewards Contract**, distributed slowly over time to LP token holders, or
- Directed to the **Treasury**, where it can be used for buybacks, additional liquidity, or community rewards.
- The allocation decision will be announced **publicly on official channels (e.g., X)**, and community sentiment may be measured through polls.

**Possible Treasury Scenario:**
If **1,000,000,000 STREET** are earmarked for treasury use, the over-subscribed WELSH can pair with those tokens for future buybacks, more locked liquidity, or LP rewards.

---

### Undersubscription Scenario (Less than 20 M WELSH Raised)

If less WELSH is raised than expected:

- All participants still receive their full share of the **20,000,000 STREET allocation**, which means each WELSH contributed earns **more STREET**.
- The deployer may add **private WELSH funds** to reach the target pool ratio, or
- Proceed with a smaller WELSH pool, allowing the market to find a new equilibrium naturally.

Undersubscription effectively rewards early supporters with a larger proportional STREET claim.

## Fairness Mechanisms

| Concern | Mechanism | Who Decides | Transparency |
|----------|------------|-------------|---------------|
| Oversubscription | Add extra WELSH to pool, or send to Rewards/Treasury | Deployer, with community input | Public announcement or X poll |
| Undersubscription | Add private WELSH to meet ratio or launch with smaller pool | Deployer | Public post-launch report |
| Reward pacing | Gradual release to LPs to prevent early drain | Deployer | Schedule announced in docs/X |
| Treasury use | Buybacks, added liquidity, or reward funding | Deployer, with community feedback | Publicly shared reasoning |
| Liquidity ratio | Adjusted at launch for stability | Deployer | On-chain record at pool creation |

---

## Deployer Authority Window

- The deployer retains full discretion for up to **30 days after the LGE closes** to:
- Create the liquidity pool and finalize the ratio.
- Allocate oversubscription or manage deficits.
- Establish the initial LP reward schedule.
- After this period, major future actions (buybacks, reward adjustments, liquidity additions) will be shared publicly and may be preceded by **informal community votes via official Welsh Street channels** such as **X**.

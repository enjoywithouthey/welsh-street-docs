# Roadmap

## Bootstrapping Phase

### Seed Round

Fun, fundraising event to pool community WELSh and stacks together to seed the liquidity round.  A portion of the initial minted upply will be distributed to participants in the seed round.

### The Great Liquidity Burn

The deployer mints the first round of liquidity using the geometric mean. Explain geometric mean as applied to first time provisioning of the AMM Uniswap V2 liquidity pool.

The liquidity is not immediately burned until traditional LP providers come onboard.  Early adopters always have a benefit for being early, but the slow liquidity burn guarantees the early adopters don;t get a massive out-sized and unfair position to dump on future entrants.

The community may also decide, instead of burning thee LP tokens, to list them on another exchange to be part of a secondary market (ai we need to explore this scenario and see what that does to the rewards pool holders.)

## Adoption Phase

During the adoption pase, there will only be one liquidity pool, WELSH / STREET where users can claim STREET rewards and grow their WELSH holdings.  Then they may choose to provide more WELSH and STREET to earn more CREDIT.

During this phase there will be many community initiatives, especially on social media, including meme contests and trading contests.  The Welsh Street Exchange and community may also elect to airdrop STREET to certain holder groups and users.


## Growth Phase

The hallmark of the growth phase will be more STREET and CREDIT listings outside of the Welsh Street Exchange.  This phase will signal the broader adoption of WELSH STREET into the Stacks ecosystem.  This will include aggregating the WELSH / STREET pool and other pools into DEX aggregators such as Charisma and Bitflow.

The Welsh Street Exchange and community may also utilize treasury reserves for STREET and CREDIT listings on other exchanges.

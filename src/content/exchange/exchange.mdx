## Welsh Street Decentralized Exchange

**Inspired by the pioneering spirit of WELSH**, Welsh Street Exchange is a **next-generation DeFi AMM** built on Stacks blockchain that honors the legacy of Bitcoin's first memecoin while pushing the boundaries of DeFi innovation. Our protocol introduces the world's first **dedicated meme rewards token** (STREET) and pioneering **tradable LP token architecture** to create sustainable yield for liquidity providers.

Welsh Street Exchange was born from the recognition that **WELSH deserved a proper home**—a sophisticated DeFi platform that could match the innovation and community spirit that made WELSH the beloved mascot of Stacks blockchain. Unlike conventional DEXs focused purely on trading, Welsh Street transforms liquidity provision into a **yield-generating strategy** through:

- **Bitcoin-Aligned Emissions**: STREET tokens minted every Bitcoin block for predictable, long-term rewards
- **Tradable LP Tokens**: First Stacks DEX with transferable, composable liquidity positions  
- **Three-Tier Liquidity System**: Standard provision, permanent locking, and community-benefiting burns
- **Battle-Tested Mathematics**: Compound/Aave-style reward distribution for perfect scalability

Welsh Street isn't just another AMM—it's the **infrastructure for sustainable DeFi yield** on Stacks, where providing liquidity becomes more profitable than speculation. Whether you're earning STREET rewards, trading CREDIT tokens, or participating in community governance, Welsh Street makes DeFi **profitable, fair, and fun**.


### Overview: The Welsh-Dedicated Economic Engine

Welsh Street Exchange implements a **purpose-built constant product AMM** designed specifically to solve the economic challenges facing WELSH and similar community coins. Unlike generic multi-token DEXs, every feature is **optimized for the WELSH/STREET economy** - from the three distinct liquidity mechanisms to the specialized fee structures that create sustainable yield for WELSH holders.

The exchange transforms WELSH from an **idle community asset** into the **foundation of an active DeFi economy**, providing the missing economic engine that enables continuous market activity, yield generation, and ecosystem growth.
